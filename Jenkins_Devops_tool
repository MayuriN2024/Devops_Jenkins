Y jenkins?????????????????????????????????
" the work we do manually jenkins can automate that work"
if we do build and delployment process manually than it s time taking processa nd error prone.
to overcome above problems, we need to automate project build and deployment process.
 to auotmate project build and deployment process we will use jenkins.

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool that helps development teams manage the software delivery process. It's used to: 
Automate testing: Jenkins can automatically test code changes in real time. 
Integrate code: Jenkins can integrate code branches into a main branch. 
Deploy code: Jenkins can deploy code to containers, virtual machines, and cloud servers. 
Speed up development: Jenkins can automate and speed up the software development process.
